1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And here we approach the culmination of each level â€“ the hole.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the moment when all skills, mastery, and strategy converge in one point.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Before us is the hole, neatly carved in the well-groomed green grass, symbolizing the goal of every golfer.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Not far from it, on the edge of the field, lies a ball, as if waiting for the final decisive strike.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It didn't roll all the way to the goal, leaving the player a chance to demonstrate their artistry and accuracy.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This moment is a real test of the player's skills, their ability to judge the distance, angle, and strength of the strike.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
A slight movement of the club, seeming almost like a gentle touch, and the ball will head on its final journey to the hole.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is a magical moment in golf, when time seems to stand still,

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and then explodes with applause and admiration, as the ball finally finds its home in the hole.
