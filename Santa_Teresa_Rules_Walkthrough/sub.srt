1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Before me stands 'The Habits of a 4-Hour Golfer', a sign that seems to greet everyone who comes here for a game.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
These few rules remind us of courtesy and strategy, making the game more enjoyable for everyone.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I leave them behind, heading to the main building of the 'Santa Teresa' club.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Reaching the main building, I meet players engrossed in tactical discussions.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Behind them are golf carts, prepared for play on the green expanses of the field.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Passing by the focused players, each absorbed in their game, I feel a connection with the past.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Golf, with its centuries-old history, originated in Scotland in the 15th century,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
evolving from a simple game played by shepherds into a renowned global sport.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
These fields bear witness to numerous strategies and strokes, honed over years and passed down through generations.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Here, where each swing of the club is written into history, every player continues an ancient tradition,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
combining respect for the past with modern innovations of the game.
