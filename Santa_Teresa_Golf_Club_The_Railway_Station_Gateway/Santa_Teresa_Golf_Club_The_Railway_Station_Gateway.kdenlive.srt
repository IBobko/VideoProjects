00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
And here we are at the Convention Center Station, located on San Carlos Street.

00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,533
This is a key hub of the VTA light rail, connecting the blue and green lines.

Look at the display: the next train to Santa Teresa departs in 9 minutes, followed by another in 37 minutes.

00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,566
The station, updated in 2006 for full accessibility, is situated right in the heart of the city's hustle and bustle.

00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:35,400
From here, you can easily walk to many of San Jose's iconic locations, including the California Theatre, home to Opera San JosÃ©,

00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,466
and the San Jose Convention Center, located just across the street.

00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:46,033
And of course, within walking distance are the San Jose Civic and the Center for the Performing Arts.

00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:49,366
This place is a true intersection of culture and transport.

00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:54,533
But now, our path leads to the green expanses of the golf course.
