Hello everyone! Today is a special day for us â€“ we are heading to the Santa Teresa golf club.

2
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:32,566
Here I am, walking down Market Street in San Jose, where every corner is filled with its own stories.

3
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:41,166
Here, in the heart of Silicon Valley, you'll not only encounter innovative startups but also feel the spirit of the old city.

4
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:48,833
I am now heading to the Convention Center station, which is part of the Light Rail network in San Jose.

5
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:57,266
It's not just a transportation artery, but a true symbol of the city, connecting the past with the present.

6
00:03:57,266 --> 00:04:06,300
It's fascinating that in just a few minutes, we will move from the hustle and bustle of the city to the tranquility and seclusion of the golf course.

7
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,433
This will be a real journey from urban noise to nature and sports.

8
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:20,366
Soon, we will find ourselves in the open green spaces, where each swing at the ball is an art and skill.

9
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:24,300
Join me, there's much interesting ahead!
